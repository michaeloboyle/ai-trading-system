### 🏗️ System Architecture
```
AI Decision Layer:    Multi-Agent LLM + xLSTM + Attention Mechanisms
Performance Layer:    Rust-WASM (10-100x faster than JavaScript)
Trading Strategies:   Stablecoin Arbitrage → Momentum → Futures Scalping  
Risk Management:      $10 max loss/trade, $20 daily limit, $200 reserve
Capital Growth:       $1000 → $1200 → $1800 → $2700+ (3-month target)
```

### 🎨 2025 Research Integration
- **LLM Multi-Agent System** (Jan 2025) - Portfolio management coordination
- **ReMA Meta-thinking** (May 2025) - Strategic vs tactical decision separation  
- **xLSTM Networks** (March 2025) - Enhanced pattern recognition
- **Attention Mechanisms** - Cross-exchange arbitrage detection

### 📊 Success Metrics
- **Financial**: 20-50% monthly returns, <5% max drawdown
- **Technical**: <50ms trade decisions, 99.9% uptime
- **Learning**: Continuous strategy improvement, new pattern discovery
- **Risk**: 100% compliance with position limits

### 🛡️ Risk Management
- Maximum $10 loss per trade (1% of $1000 capital)
- Daily loss limit $20 (2% of capital) with auto-shutdown
- Emergency reserve $200 (20% untouchable)
- Position sizing 5-20% of capital per trade

### 📈 Implementation Phases
1. **Week 1**: Stablecoin arbitrage + risk management (MVP)
2. **Week 2**: AI integration + multi-agent coordination
3. **Week 3**: Momentum trading + futures scalping
4. **Month 2-3**: Advanced learning + scaling preparation

### 🔧 Technology Stack
- **Core**: Node.js/TypeScript + Rust-WASM
- **AI**: Local Ollama + Groq API + selective cloud LLM
- **Data**: PostgreSQL + Redis + WebSocket feeds
- **Exchanges**: Binance (primary) + Coinbase (secondary)
- **Monitoring**: Custom dashboard + Grafana + mobile alerts
