# PROFIT-FIRST Crypto Trading System

## Prime Directive: Profitable Trading ASAP
**Starting Capital: $1000** | Target: 20-50% monthly returns

Based on 2024/2025 research, **3 capital-efficient strategies** optimized for small accounts:

### 1. Stablecoin Triangular Arbitrage (Fastest ROI - Days)
**Capital Requirement**: $50-200 per trade | **Daily Target**: $20-40 (2-4%)
- **USDT/USDC/DAI spreads** on single exchange (no transfer delays)
- **Position Size**: 5-20% of capital per trade
- **Frequency**: 10-20 opportunities/day
- **Risk**: <0.1% per trade (stablecoin stability)

### 2. Small-Cap Altcoin Momentum (Medium ROI - 1-2 weeks)  
**Capital Requirement**: $100-300 per trade | **Daily Target**: $30-60 (3-6%)
- **Sub-$100M market cap** coins with high volatility
- **5-minute momentum breakouts** (avoid overnight holds)
- **2-3% profit targets** with 1% stop-loss
- **Position Size**: 10-30% of capital per trade

### 3. Binance Futures Scalping (High ROI - 2-3 weeks)
**Capital Requirement**: $200-500 per position | **Daily Target**: $50-100 (5-10%)
- **BTC/ETH perpetual futures** with 3-5x leverage
- **1-minute chart scalping** (30-60 second holds)
- **0.1-0.3% profit targets** with tight stops
- **Position Size**: 20-50% of capital (leveraged)

## Rust->WASM Acceleration Stack

### Performance Critical Path (Implement First)
```rust
// Core modules for WASM compilation
mod orderbook_analysis;    // Level-2/3 data processing
mod arbitrage_scanner;     // Cross-exchange price monitoring  
mod signal_generator;      // ML inference pipeline
mod risk_calculator;       // Position sizing & stop-loss
```

### Architecture: Hybrid Node.js + Rust-WASM
- **Node.js**: Exchange APIs, database, orchestration
- **Rust-WASM**: Real-time analysis, signal generation, risk calculations
- **Performance**: 10-100x faster than pure JavaScript for math-heavy operations

- **Neural predictions**: "Consistent profitability" proven on minute-level data
- **Market microstructure**: Predictive power for price dynamics confirmed

## Current Status  
System needs **crypto-first rebuild** focusing on speed and profit extraction rather than traditional stock analysis.

## Required Changes for Crypto Trading

### 1. Exchange Integration (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Add Binance/Coinbase API connector to `data-fetcher` service
- [ ] Implement WebSocket for real-time crypto prices
- [ ] Add exchange-specific order management
- [ ] Handle 24/7 market hours (remove NYSE schedule)

### 2. Strategy Adaptation (3-5 days)
- [ ] Adjust RSI parameters for crypto volatility (current: 14-period)
- [ ] Add crypto-specific indicators (funding rates, on-chain metrics)
- [ ] Modify risk limits for higher volatility (current: 2% stop loss)

### 3. Database Schema (2-3 days)
- [ ] Add exchange and asset_type columns
- [ ] Support fractional positions (crypto decimals)
- [ ] Store exchange-specific metadata

### 4. Quick Start Steps

#### Option A: Paper Trading (Recommended - 1 day setup)
```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone <repo>
cd ai-trading-system
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Add Binance testnet credentials to .env
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_testnet_key
BINANCE_SECRET_KEY=your_testnet_secret
BINANCE_TESTNET=true

# 3. Start with paper trading
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Option B: Minimal Live Trading (Use with caution)
```bash
# Same as above but with real API keys
BINANCE_TESTNET=false
STARTING_BALANCE=100  # Start small!
RISK_LIMIT=0.01      # 1% max loss per trade
```

## Timeline Estimate

### Week 1: Core Integration
- Binance API connector
- Basic buy/sell orders
- Price feeds

### Week 2: Strategy & Safety
- Adapt RSI strategy for crypto
- Add safety checks
- Test with paper trading

### Week 3: Production Ready
- Error handling
- Performance optimization
- Live trading with small amounts

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Choose exchange**: Binance (lowest fees, best liquidity) or Coinbase (US-friendly)
2. **Get API keys**: Create account, enable API, get testnet access
3. **Start development**: Focus on `data-fetcher` service first

## Risk Warnings
- Crypto markets are 24/7 and highly volatile
- Start with paper trading for at least 2 weeks
- Never risk more than you can afford to lose
- Current strategy (RSI) may need significant tuning for crypto

## Want to Start Today?
The fastest path is using existing crypto trading bots while this system is adapted:
- Freqtrade (Python, similar architecture)
- Gekko (Node.js, simpler but less features)
- 3Commas (SaaS, no coding required)
